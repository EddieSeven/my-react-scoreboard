# React Scoreboard "VersusBoard" 

VersusBoard is a standalone web scoreboard developed in React.js. It is designed to be full-screened and act an actual scoreboard for a sporting event, either on a monitor, or outputted to an outdoor video billboard. Once the original goal is met, responsive views will be added for other viewports.

Currently it needs to be downloaded and deployed by npm. Once running, it will be on port 3000.

As of 6/15/18, functionality is limited to raising the scores by clicking on each, and a timer that can be started and paused/unpaused. Upcoming updates will add a timer re-set, as well as incrementors/decrementors for each field. Yard line and down/yards to go will be intuitively implemented, so the user needs to only input the yardage (positve or negative), and the downs, yards remaining, and yard line will update accordingly. 

A settings window will be part of these updates that will enable the user to select team/player names, logos, and colors.

A help button will be added to provide instructions to the user.

A UI update wille also be performed, adding graphics, modern styling, and animations.

This is currently a (American) Football scoreboard, as it is one of the most complex. The plan is to make the sport selectable in the Settings menu, and the scoreboard changes to reflect that preference.

This Readme will be updated as the project progresses.
